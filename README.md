# MemoriChain
Memori Chain is a new concept EVM blockchain

There is a large problem in today's EVM blockchain list, below I will list problems I see and what I look to solve:
1: Low TPS; Most public EVM blockchains have a very low TPS and so will adventually run into scaling issues with adoption. We saw this with the Binance smart chain at the peak of Crypto Mines Eternal adoption. The blockchain went down several times with a lot of investors being affected by not being able to manage assets at the time and incured losses due to the chain going down. This was caused by peak TPS being reached on chain by NFT game CryptoMines Eternal. Memori Chain will boast a 150k TPS. To give you an idea of how much of an improvment this is in comparison to other blockchains, here is a list of popular blockchains tps:
- BTC: 5TPS
- ETH: 10TPS
- BSC: 150TPS
As you can see, we offer a large scale more TPS blockchain service and thus, with major adoption, we will not incur these problems. 

2: Public Mempool: Public Mempools have their perks for only a small handful of Blockchain users. You will usually find having public access to the Mempool provides direct access to unverified transactions waiting to be verified, this opens the gateway for only people with the relivant knowledge to take advantage of users who don't have the same knowledge.
What are the main disadvantages for blockchains that use Public Mempools?
- This allows for MEV bots and attackers to frontrun or attack people when making purchases on Decentralized exchanges whilst using incorrect slippage, this means if the trader using high slippage with large price impact is either buying and selling, a MEV bot can track the transaction before it is validated through the public Mempool and front run the transaction with a higher gas limit, which then allows them to profit off the price impact. 
- Sniper bots have 1st in, 1st served access, VIP access if you will, to all contracts which have liquidity added for the open market to trade. This gives them ground floor price access and usually results in the real investors who care about the project and want to see it flourish, then get dumped on by these same sniper bots. Sniper bots are also utilized in hyped NFT mints, presale/IDO's and even farming/staking contracts to get in before any normal human investor is and maximise profits.
